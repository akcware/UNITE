        <p class="term-light text-center">UNITE is a Public Procurement Platform exclusively for governmental procurement of special orders of products and services for crisis response.
            <br>We call it "The Alibaba of urgent public procurement requests."<br><br>
            UNITE is a two-sided platform, connecting public buyers with companies that have the capability and capacity to refocus their activities to supplying goods and services in response to the COVID-19 crisis.<br><br>
            Companies are invited to register on the platform, describing their capability and capacity to manufacture urgently needed products or to supply in-demand services.
            <br>Companies may also browse and respond to open tender requests that have been placed by public buyers.
            <br><br>
            Public buyers may access the platform and create a procurement request. Our software matches the procurement request with potential suppliers and facilitates the complete transaction - including initial contact, negotiation. order placement, delivery acceptance, and payment.
        </p>
      <p class="term-light text-center">
        UNITE differentiates itself from other solutions in that it provides a database of companies with capability to refocus operations and in that it automates the process. Other solutions include using existing suppliers and ERP/purchasing system (not suited to abnormal requirements); engagement with the market through contacting individual companies by email, telephone or in person (which is slow); use of other online sales platforms (no visibility of companies' ability to refocus operations); and public buyersâ€™ own knowledge and connections to industry (not widely shared - limited to individuals or local teams).
